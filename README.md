# Welcome to my dotfiles!

Always a WIP and I'm always learning new and better ways to do stuff:)
(forreal tho this could be way better it's kinda basic)

### Highlights
- Primarily for macOS
	- I wanna include more configuration that targets my linux machine
- NeoVim
- kitty term
	- I transitioned away from Alacritty cause I wanted some more features but it's still pretty cool
- tmux
	- used with Alacritty like all the time
	- now used when remoting into other machines
	- now I rely on kitty's tabs and windows when working locally
- Homebrew
	- `brew bundle dump`-ed my installed formulae and casks
- zsh
	- I enjoyed using fish cause of the autosuggestions and pretty colors but I wanna go back to something more ubiquitous and powerful

### TODOs
- [ ] an install script would be pretty cool 
- [ ] zsh functions to do stuff like:
	- [ ] edit dotfiles in a new kitty tab
	- [ ] cheat.sh in a new kitty tab
	- [ ] automate stuff in macOS
- [ ] kittens
	- [ ] see if making a kitten to copy my tmux conf to a remote machine makes sense
- [ ] tidy up the dirs
	- [ ] remove folders for stuff I don't use much anymore
- [ ] make this README make more sense and format it properly
