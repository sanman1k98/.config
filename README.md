# Welcome to my dotfiles!

Always a WIP and I'm always learning new and better ways to do stuff:)
(forreal tho this could be way better it's kinda basic)

### Highlights
- Primarily for macOS
	- I wanna include more configuration that targets my linux machine
- NeoVim
- kitty term
	- I transitioned away from Alacritty cause I wanted some more features but it's still pretty cool
- tmux
	- Used with Alacritty but less so when I'm working locally on my machine and with kitty
- Homebrew
- zsh
	- I enjoyed using fish cause of the autosuggestions and pretty colors but I wanna go back to something more ubiquitous and powerful

### TODOs
- an install script would be pretty cool 
- zsh functions to do stuff like:
	- edit dotfiles
	- cheat.sh
	- automate stuff in macOS
- tidy up the dirs
