# Welcome to my dotfiles!

Always a WIP and I'm always learning new and better ways to do stuff:)

### Highlights
- Primarily for macOS
	- I wanna include more configuration that targets my linux machine
- NeoVim
- kitty term
	- I transitioned away from Alacritty cause I wanted some more features but it's still pretty cool
- tmux
	- used with Alacritty like all the time
	- now used when remoting into other machines
	- now I rely on kitty's tabs and windows when working locally
- Homebrew
	- `brew bundle dump`-ed my installed formulae and casks
- zsh
	- I enjoyed using fish cause of the autosuggestions and pretty colors but I wanna go back to something more ubiquitous and powerful
